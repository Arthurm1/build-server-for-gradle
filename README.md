- `build/initialize`
- `build/initialized`
- `build/shutdown`
- `build/exit`
- `buildTarget/sources`
- `buildTarget/resources`
- `buildTarget/outputPaths`
- `buildTarget/dependencyModules`
- `buildTarget/dependencySources`
- `buildTarget/inverseSources`
- `buildTarget/compile`
- `buildTarget/cleanCache`
- `buildTarget/javacOptions`
- `buildTarget/scalacOptions`
- `buildTarget/jvmCompileClasspath`
- `buildTarget/test`
- `buildTarget/run`
- `buildTarget/jvmRunEnvironment`
- `buildTarget/jvmTestEnvironment`
- `workspace/buildTargets`
- `workspace/reload`

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Launch the Build Server for Gradle

### Main class

The main class of the build server is `com.microsoft.java.bs.core.Launcher`.  The latest version can be downloaded from maven `com.github.arthurm1:gradle-bsp-server:0.5.0` or local versions can be used by incrementing `version` in `gradle.properties` and then publishing to local maven using `gradlew publishToLocalMaven`.
The tests will always use the latest built code in `.../build/classes/java/main/...` regardless of whether the jars have been published.

### BSP message logging

Set the `bsp.gradle.traceMessagesFile` system property to a file location (e.g. `~/bsp.trace.json`) to log all BSP messages to file.  The file will be truncated on restart of BSP server

### Preferences

A [Preferences](./server/src/main/java/com/microsoft/java/bs/core/internal/model/Preferences.java) object can be put into the data field of the `build/initialize` request for customization. Please check the comments in the code for the meaning of each preference.

### Transport Method

The Gradle Build Server supports two types of transport methods: standard input/output and named pipe (unix socket). By default, the server uses the standard input/output transport if no arguments are specified.

To use the named pipe (unix socket) transport, start the server with the argument `--pipe=<pipeName>`. If the `--pipe=` option is provided but `pipeName` left empty, the server defaults to using the standard input/output transport.
